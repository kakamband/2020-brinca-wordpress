# Changelog Notes

A good change log sticks to these principles:

- It’s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.
- List releases in reverse-chronological order (newest on top).
- Write all dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. (Example: `2012-06-02` for `June 2nd, 2012`.) It’s international, sensible, and language-independent.

Each version should:

- List its release date in the above format.
- Group changes to describe their impact on the project, as follows:
  - `Added` for new features.
  - `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
  - `Deprecated` for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
  - `Removed` for deprecated features removed in this release.
  - `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
  - `Security` to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.

Always have an `Unreleased` section at the top for keeping track of any changes. This serves two purposes:

- People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
- At release time, you just have to change `Unreleased` to the version number and add a new `Unreleased` header at the top.
